            <p><strong>Focus on the story</strong> 
                Creative cinematography style is important but not more than the story. If a story is not good or not appropriately shown, having just good visual effects or techniques will not make the film great. Concerning this, Roger Deakins, the great cinematographer said: "There's nothing worse than an ostentatious shot or some lighting that draws attention to itself, and you might go, 'Oh, wow, that's spectacular.' Or that spectacular shot, a big crane move, or something. But it's not necessarily right for the film â€” you jump out, you think about the surface, and you don't stay in there with the characters and the story." The visual look of the film should be based on the factor that makes the film better.</p>
            <p><strong>Find the best location</strong>
                A good location can elevate the film to a different level. Take note of the lighting and weather conditions at different times of the day and year. A good location would mean that a cinematographer and the crew has to work less. A bad location would take more effort to achieve the desired result.</p>
            <p><strong>Learn from the best</strong>
                The great cinematographers also have learned from the greats before them. A cinematographer can gain knowledge and pass it on to the next generation by improving the cinematography techniques. Orson Welles, who made the well-acclaimed film Citizen Kane said that John Ford greatly inspired him. Legendary cinematographer John Ford is known to invent various lighting and camera techniques such as the western and chiaroscuro. Welles learned the techniques from Ford and created his own classics and developed innovatory lighting techniques.</p>
            <p><strong>Do camera tests</strong>
                Doing proper tests before a shoot is critical. Various components can go wrong when the actual shoot takes place. A cinematographer can do the camera test by using chip carts, color charts, and models. Along with testing, handling, and maintaining the equipment are also important.</p>
            <P><strong>Don't depend on Post Production</strong>
                The best way to get good results is to get it right in the camera. Post-production can help, but it won't make a badly shot video good. Working on post-production will take more time and money. A good cinematographer makes use of location, lighting, and other shooting techniques to make the cinematography outstanding.</P>
