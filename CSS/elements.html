        <h2>Elements</h2>    
        <p>A cinematographer or director of photography (shortened to DP or DoP) is the crew chief that presides over the camera and light crews on a film or video production. They are involved throughout the entire production and liaise closely with the director to create the images you see. What elements do they consider? We'll cover the basic considerations here.</p>

         <p><strong>Lighting</strong>
            While there is a separate lighting person, cinematography demands this knowledge. After all, cinematography is what we see on-screen, and how well or horribly the scene is lit is a huge aspect of the craft. 3-point lighting is a very common lighting setup but there are many styles and approaches to lighting. For example, Rembrandt lighting brings a lot of dimension to lighting a subject's face and chiaroscuro lighting is ideal to convey dark and dangerous situations.</p>
        <p><strong>Shot Size</strong>
            How much of the scene is actually seen? Are we in a close-up watching a subject's face change expression? Maybe it's an extreme close-up on a subject's attire indicating to the audience that they should pay attention to this.</p>
        <p><strong>Camera Focus</strong>
            Part of a cinematographer's job is to play with focus to emphasize different aspects of the story. A basic example of this is showing how intoxicated the character is by going in and out of focus. There are many types of camera focus available, each with their own particular storytelling value.</p>
        <p><strong>Shot Composition</strong>
            Composition refers to the way elements of a scene are arranged in a camera frame. Shot composition refers to the arrangement of visual elements to convey an intended message.</p>
        <p><strong>Camera placement</strong>
            Where they place the camera greatly affects how the audience reacts to the shot, and therefore the rest of the scene. It can have significant emotional impact or even convey character behavior.</p>
        <p><strong>Camera movement</strong>
            Camera movement can heighten the emotion and suspense in a scene. Choose to move the camera with the characters and gain perspective. Keep the camera static, and now we're separated from them, peering in.</p>
